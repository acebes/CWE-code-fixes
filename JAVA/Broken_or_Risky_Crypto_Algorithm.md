Argon2 is a secure hashing algorithm designed specifically for password hashing and key derivation. It's designed to be resistant to both GPU and ASIC attacks, making it a good choice for securely hashing sensitive data like passwords. Here’s how you can use Argon2 in Java to hash a string:

### Using Argon2 in Java

To use Argon2 in Java, you typically need to include a library that provides an implementation of Argon2. One popular library that supports Argon2 is the `argon2-jvm` library, which is a Java binding for the official Argon2 reference implementation.

#### Step 1: Add Dependency

First, you need to include the `argon2-jvm` dependency in your project. If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.mkammerer</groupId>
    <artifactId>argon2-jvm</artifactId>
    <version>2.10</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version available -->
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the dependency to your `build.gradle`:

```groovy
implementation 'de.mkammerer:argon2-jvm:2.10' // Replace with the latest version available
```

#### Step 2: Hashing a String with Argon2

Here’s an example of how to hash a string using Argon2 in Java:

```java
import de.mkammerer.argon2.Argon2;
import de.mkammerer.argon2.Argon2Factory;

public class Argon2Example {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an instance of Argon2
        Argon2 argon2 = Argon2Factory.create();

        // Example string to hash
        String password = "secret123";

        try {
            // Hash the password
            String hash = argon2.hash(10, 65536, 1, password.toCharArray());

            // Print the hashed password (store this in your database)
            System.out.println("Hashed password: " + hash);

            // Verify the password (example, in real scenario you would retrieve hash from database)
            boolean matched = argon2.verify(hash, password.toCharArray());
            System.out.println("Password matched: " + matched);
        } finally {
            // Ensure the Argon2 instance is securely wiped
            argon2.wipeArray(password.toCharArray());
        }
    }
}
```

#### Explanation

- **Argon2 Instance**: You create an instance of `Argon2` using `Argon2Factory.create()`.

- **Hashing Parameters**: 
  - `argon2.hash()` method takes parameters:
    - `iterations`: Number of iterations (10 in the example).
    - `memory`: Memory costs (65536 in the example, in kibibytes).
    - `parallelism`: Parallelism factor (1 in the example).
    - `password`: The password to hash, provided as a `char` array.

- **Hash Verification**:
  - `argon2.verify()` method is used to verify a password against a previously hashed value.

- **Secure Wiping**: After hashing and verifying the password, use `argon2.wipeArray()` to securely wipe the sensitive data (the password).

#### Best Practices

- **Secure Storage**: Store the resulting hash securely in your database. The hash contains all necessary parameters, including the salt, which are needed for verification.

- **Parameters**: Adjust the hashing parameters (`iterations`, `memory`, `parallelism`) according to your security requirements. Higher values provide stronger security but may impact performance.

- **Handling Exceptions**: Always handle exceptions properly, especially when dealing with sensitive data operations.

By using Argon2 in this manner, you can securely hash strings (such as passwords) in your Java applications, providing strong protection against common attacks like brute-force and dictionary attacks.
